# Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a text. It involves analyzing the 
words and phrases used in the text to identify the underlying sentiment, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

There are several ways to perform sentiment analysis on text data, with varying degrees of complexity and accuracy. The most common
methods include a lexicon-based approach, a machine learning (ML) based approach, and a pre-trained transformer-based deep learning approach. Letâ€™s look at each in more detail

## Lexicon-based analysis

This type of analysis, such as the NLTK Vader sentiment analyzer, involves using a set of predefined rules and heuristics to determine the sentiment of a piece of text. These rules
are typically based on lexical and syntactic features of the text, such as the presence of positive or negative words and phrases.[]
